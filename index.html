        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>To this day, the Wii is still regarded as one of the most influential consoles ever made- and one of the most influential things to come out of it's decade!</p>
        <p>Most people don't look back too fawnly on it's sort of 'gimmick' that is the Wiimotes usage of motion controls since- for a while in the console's life-span- it wasn't... <em>the greatest...</em> but after the new 'Wii-Motion Plus' technology released, the motion controls were <em>useable</em></p>
        <p>Many people still refer to the Wii for it's visual aesthetics and music found in it's launch titles and the console's own system menus and apps as well!</p>
